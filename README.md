# OpenSourceBook

This is an attempt to collaborate with writers all over the world to create a stand alone Novel with multiple authors.


The rules for adding chapters/stories/folklore/scenes/places/maps etc are under development and subject to change.

For starters all files should be submitted in RTF format.
All chapters should be labeled as "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2" so on and so forth.
If there are multiple scenes in a single chapter, please separate them with a three asterisks "* * *"
